# Testing the API

Once your API is up and running, it's crucial to write tests to ensure it is bug-free and to prevent future regressions.
A good practice is to follow a [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html)
approach, where tests are written before the production code.

API Platform provides a set of helpful testing utilities to write unit tests, functional tests, and to create
[test fixtures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture#Software).

## Testing Documentations

- If you are using API Platform with Symfony, refer to the [Testing the API with Symfony](/symfony/testing.md) documentation.
- If you are using API Platform with Laravel, refer to the [Testing the API with Laravel](/laravel/testing.md) documentation.
